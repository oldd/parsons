# Parsons Problems

This repository contains a very simple but powerful type of exercise.  With parsons problems you will be presented with a randomly organized set of lines of code.  Your task is simply to place them in order.  But it's not always as easy as it sounds!  Beware of indenting (code style) and extra lines.

## Specifications

1. Study the [provided problems](https://jankelearning.github.io/parsons).  But not just once!  Be sure to review each one a few times until you can solve it without thinking.
2. When you find a particularly interesting problem, step through it and provide a link in your JavaScript Reference.
3. Create your own problems and challenge your friends!  The problems we've provided are relatively basic, but parsons problems are also a great way to learn more complicated logic and programming design patterns.
